## Introduction
ECommerce, or Electronic Commerce, refers to the buying and selling of goods or services using the internet, and the transfer of money and data to execute these transactions. It has transformed the traditional retail landscape, enabling businesses to reach a global audience with minimal physical presence. eCommerce is not just limited to online shopping; it encompasses a wide range of activities including online auctions, payment gateways, online ticketing, and internet banking.

The growth of eCommerce has been propelled by the advancement in technology, particularly mobile computing and online payment systems, making it more accessible and convenient for consumers worldwide. It allows for a more personalized shopping experience through data analytics, targeted marketing, and customer service chatbots.
